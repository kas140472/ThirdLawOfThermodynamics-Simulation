<center>Experiment: Third Law of Thermodynamics</center>

**1. Story Outline**:

The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at a temperature of zero Kelvin (which is known as the absolute zero) is zero.

Entropy is a measure of the molecular disorder or the randomness of the system. At the absolute zero temperature, the system does not contain any heat and the atoms and molecules are at their lowest energy points i,e. ground states. Therefore, the entropy of such a system is zero.

This experiment depicts the third law with the help of balls (that can be thought of as atoms) whose speed, which is a representation of its energy, changes with the temperature until it goes to absolute zero.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:

  The experiment consists of around 70 balls. All the buttons and parameters control the right corner of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for the temperature.

  The setup consists of around 70 balls that behave like atoms in this experiment.

  By changing the temperature of the system using the slider or the spinner, the speed of the atoms (and hence their energy and entropy) changes. When the temperature is 0K, it is displayed that the entropy of the system is zero and that it is a perfect crystal.

  **2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals**:

  1. Understand the third law of thermodynamics and its implications for a perfect crystal.
  2. Interpret the change in the speed of the atoms as the temperature changes.
  3. Calculate the entropy of the system at 0K.

  **2.3 Set the pathway activities**:

  1. The initial temperature is taken as 0K.<br>
  2. The temperature can be varied from 0 to 273K.<br>\

  Change the parameters of the system to understand the change in the entropy of the atoms.

**2.6 Conclusion**:

The time required to perform the virtual experiment:

The approximate time required to understand the third law, formulae and the procedure of the experiment would be 5 mins. The time required to understand the change the temperature to notice the change in the speed (hence energy and entropy) of the system is 5 mins. Thus, the total time required to perform the experiment is about 10 mins.
