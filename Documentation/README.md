<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this lab is to depict the third law of thermodynamics with the help of spheres (representing atoms) whose speed, which is a representation of their energy, changes with the temperature until the temperature becomes absolute zero.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at a temperature of zero Kelvin (which is known as the absolute zero) is zero.
<br><br>
Entropy is a measure of the molecular disorder or the randomness of the system. At the absolute zero temperature, the system does not contain any heat and the atoms and molecules are at their lowest energy points i.e., ground states. Therefore, the entropy of such a system is zero.
