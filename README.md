# Third Law of Thermodynamics

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this lab is to depict the third law of thermodynamics with the help of spheres (representing atoms) whose speed, which is a representation of their energy, changes with the temperature until the temperature becomes absolute zero.
